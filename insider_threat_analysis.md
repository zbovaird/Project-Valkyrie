# Insider Threat Detection: Privilege and Asset Escalation Analysis

## Problem Context
Insider threats represent a significant security challenge, with 43% of all breaches caused by malicious insiders or inadvertent actors (IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2023). Organizations face two critical challenges:
1. Detection of subtle privilege escalation patterns
2. Identification of abnormal asset access sequences

Security teams struggle with traditional detection methods due to:
- High false positive rates in SIEM rules
- Inability to detect slow-moving threats
- Lack of context in user behavior analytics
- Limited correlation across security tools

## Build a GNN for Insider Threat Detection using GraphSAGE, supported by Splunk SOAR, optimized with UHG library

## GNN Requirements Analysis

### Do We Need a GNN?
- A GNN is highly recommended because:
    - Enterprise environments naturally form graphs
    - User-asset relationships are hierarchical
    - Privilege escalation follows graph paths
    - Access patterns require temporal context
    - Peer group behavior forms subgraphs

### Optimal GNN Architecture

#### GraphSAGE vs GCN Comparison

##### GraphSAGE Advantages
- Inductive learning capabilities
    * Can handle new users and systems
    * Adapts to environment changes
    * Learns from partial graphs
- Efficient neighborhood sampling
    * Scales with enterprise size
    * Handles dynamic relationships
    * Processes heterogeneous nodes
- Parallel processing support
    * Real-time analysis possible
    * Efficient batch updates
    * Distributed computation ready

##### GCN Limitations
- Transductive learning only
    * Requires complete graph retraining
    * Struggles with new nodes
    * Fixed graph structure
- Full graph processing
    * Poor scalability
    * High memory requirements
    * Slow update cycles
- Homogeneous graph assumption
    * Limited node type support
    * Rigid relationship models
    * Fixed feature dimensions

## Geometric Space Considerations

### Why Hyperbolic Space is Required
Unlike fraud detection, insider threat detection benefits significantly from hyperbolic geometry:

1. Natural Hierarchy Representation
   - Privilege levels form exponential trees
   - Asset access paths show clear hierarchy
   - Permission inheritance is naturally nested

2. Distance Metrics
   - Better separation between privilege levels
   - Accurate representation of access paths
   - Precise escalation pattern detection

3. Embedding Efficiency
   - Compact representation of hierarchies
   - Efficient similarity computations
   - Better preservation of graph structure

### UHG Library Benefits
- Optimized for hierarchical structures
- Efficient hyperbolic transformations
- Native support for privilege trees
- Built-in escalation pattern detection

## ML and SOAR Integration Benefits

## Technical Integration

```python
class UHGInsiderThreatModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels):
        super().__init__()
        self.uhg = ProjectiveUHG()
        
        # Privilege path
        self.priv_conv = UHGSAGEConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.priv_path = nn.ModuleList([
            UHGSAGEConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels)
            for _ in range(2)
        ])
        
        # Asset path
        self.asset_conv = UHGSAGEConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.asset_path = nn.ModuleList([
            UHGSAGEConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels)
            for _ in range(2)
        ])
        
        # Combined analysis
        self.combine = UHGSAGEConv(hidden_channels * 2, out_channels)
```

    def process_alert(self, alert_data):
        """Process insider threat alerts in SOAR"""
        return {
            'severity': self.calculate_severity(),
            'risk_factors': self.identify_risk_factors(),

    def calculate_severity(self):
        """Calculate alert severity based on multiple factors"""
        factors = {
            'privilege_level': self.assess_privilege_level(),
            'asset_sensitivity': self.assess_asset_sensitivity(),
